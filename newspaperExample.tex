TLDR: I’m a former Navy SEAL, smeared by Dianna Cowern (AKA Physics Girl) via Alphabet Inc while working as a Google employee. From 2015-2020, I have experienced severe police misconduct first hand. This is across five counties: San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Oahu and Hawaii. I think they may have ties to THE Nazis, since my entire immediate family (Donald Burns, Anne Burns and Susan Burns) are Nazis... the type that agree with Adolf Hitler and Eichmann of WWII. They lied to me about this since I was born.

Donald Burns in 2011, "... you know, like Trump, from The Apprentice? YOU'RE FIRED!". I did not. He's Donald Trump, he becomes president five years in the future. They are Hitler/Eichmann... you can see which is which, Donald and Donald. Burns is a Trump super fan from before, during the Obama administration. The relatives who were around during that sound bite are also Nazis (Bondor).

I'm becoming more convinced that \"Tomorrowland\" the movie is occurring to me. Like having a three year old robot girl in my head telling me not to slouch. That movie is of a futuristic dystopia. Trump is like Hitler. I think Donald Burns is an Eichmann. Bill Cowern as well? That rumor is unconfirmed, how dare you say that. I think he did Eichmann shit to The Physics Girl. Yes, that one... from YouTube. If all the SEALs that TPG knew from before I met her have some kind of experiment on me, I can think about that (Eichmann) connection between Cowern and Burns. What would Dirty say, I ask myself. She came in there like out other (Nazi) friend Wendy. Wendy knows more SEALs than me, somehow. This is the roommate of the wife of some Ex SEAL I refer to only as "Roomba". My nickname in the SEALs, was "Rain Man". Why did they compare TPG to Dirty? That could be kind of important. Mike Casale, "Hunty", had plenty to say about TPG as well. They all did at The Big Bang Theory House (\#BBTH), as well. May doom be unto them, expeditiously. She, and her cronies. "Noah", who I know from the Navy is a friend that I introduced to all those people. He never came to hang out with Dirty and Big Head though, more's the pity. He once told me he wanted to meet Dirty. All he got was TPG and some other asshole (Casale) that were living there with he and I as roommates. Casale is an asshole. That's why Wendy calls him Hunty... like Mike Hunt. I like that Wendy calls him Hunty and that he doesn't like it. He and TPG were closer than TPG and I. She is also and asshole. Weird. My life was different in my early twenties. There were assholes around, sure... like fucking Dirty... what those one platoon assholes she dragged in nicknamed her. She was deployment sitting a snake for one of them. The snake's name was Kah.

I blame the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN). They are heavily involved with TPG, but obfuscate this because it is so unlikely. I booked the flight through Kauai through their admin Julie. Was the SCCN hacked? No... I made that change to go there with my girlfriend Daniella for a few days en route to Osaka Japan for a BCI Neurotech conference "EMBC, 2013". My article was published with a poster presentation. The experiment was to hack the human mind with EEG, non-invasively, to identify targets which were planes embedded in random imagery of wide areas 12 times as fast as a human alone, i.e. Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). This is high (256) dimensional EEG- time-series data. It is the link to a Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI), where the computer picks the targets. If she has anything to do with them,I want to know. Is this like, some kind of Nazi network at the SCCN, and TPG knows more than she should about me from Craigslist. Seems like I was being lied to. Creepy to involve my family too. I already knew they were assholes. Swartz is the Billionaire who funds the SCCN, where I sat. My funding was portable for both undergrad and grad school: The VA executed post 911 GI Bill, then the NSF GRFP. The office space was provided by Swartz, and air travel and lodging and publishing costs for my small contribution. Before I departed, TPG jumps into roommate position, from Kauai, where I'm supposed to go with my girlfriend. Nothing like that happened. TPG is a social hand grenade, like Samantha, Wendy's friend. I think Swartz, Allen Gruber of the "Brain Corporation" and Intheon, Makeig and Kreutz are affiliated with some kind of Manhatten project thing and the Nazis. They are like Hitler/Eichmann people to me. Kreutz had heard I was a SEAL before he saw me. He lies about that and says, as if by inspection, "What are you, some kind of Special Forces guy?". I responded in the affirmative and let him get away with that. He recommended me for the SCCN in winter 2011 and I was the one who took action to set that up. I had been thinking of doing something like EEG data since late 2010 in the ICAM program at UCSD. I had a summer research gig there as well, in collaboration with The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (CalIt2). Calit2 and SCCN are bot related. 

The SCCN is tiny and was around when TPG came across my bow. I think she stalked me to Google in 2018 while I was working as a data scientist. She viewed my LinkedIn, which you can monitor if you pay for premium, which I had. Then Google goes all "evil" on me, after my last conversations with the Burnses before a trip to Maui for a few days in Christmas 2018 era. Everything was shit in CA after that. I remembered my time at Google by people casually throwing Bitch Face (BF) at me who should know better. Olivia Nottenbaum and Lawrence Fahey are my BFs. So is Wendy. I had done notable work for them and have connections to the government that they never will: damn few. Olivia had given me some award for being part of some group that I am barely a part of. I know what they do. They are more like customers than coworkers in the schema. I am upstream from them and downstream from something know as "Vector", which amounts to a code word for their new Salesforce.com instance. The one they used that year was not that, as far as I know. It was the one I generated, not Vector. Vector represents many Googlers and Deliotte personell to the tune of hundreds of headcount. What happened there? The Google data engineer's data also blew up, like Vector. Those Googlers lie to my face plenty, but they are "bad actors" in the sense that I can detect that. Then I quit immediately and unceremoniously after working at Google for 11 months. It's me dinging them and they never asked why. Now we all know. They have shady business dealings with a data vendor called \"Inricately\"? That's an unconfirmed rumor to me. The issue that made them the most money (i.e. on the order of 20B USD per year revenue for Google Cloud, which they hit and published separately in 2019) was delivering a series of "mega .csv files" that feed the new SFDC instance directly. The tolerance for noise on tens of millions of rows in the .csv files is zero, meaning not one row can be unneeded or corrupt. They are, in a sense, the Baleen team. The man who signs off is Shri. His boss Karen Gilcrest asked me to do it, as well as Jorge, my manager. After it was over, Jorge mentions that they said they wouldn't have a business plan in 2019 if it wasn't for me. I would further add, they wouldn't have had a business plan in 2019 if it were not for Intricately.
